# pizza_app_8sc_gmao

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Secrets and Firebase configuration

This repository intentionally ignores files that may contain API keys or
Firebase service account credentials. Do not commit files such as:

- `android/app/google-services.json`
- `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
- `serviceAccountKey.json` or `*-serviceAccount-*.json`
- `.env` or `.env.*`

If you need to share configuration between team members, use a secure
secrets manager or provide a sample file (e.g. `google-services.json.sample`)
without real keys and instructions to add the real file locally.
