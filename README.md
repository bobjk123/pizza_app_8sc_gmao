# 🍕 Pizza Delivery - Flutter Demo App

A small but polished pizza delivery demo built with Flutter. This repository contains a responsive multi-screen app showcasing authentication (Firebase Auth), data storage (Cloud Firestore) and a clean, adaptive UI inspired by Romain Girou's tutorial design.

--

## 🚀 Quick Overview

- **Core features:** user sign-up / sign-in, pizza catalog (Grid), pizza details, responsive layouts (phone / tablet / desktop), image fallbacks (network → local asset), and defensive Firebase reads (permission handling).
- **Audience:** students learning mobile development and Flutter UI patterns.

--

## 🧩 Main Widgets & UI Concepts

- **GridDelegate (Responsive Grid):** `SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount` is adapted at runtime using screen width to choose number of columns; tile `childAspectRatio` is computed dynamically so cards keep consistent visual proportions across devices.
- **Home Screen:** shows a grid of pizzas with thumbnails, short descriptions and tappable tiles that open `DetailsScreen`.
- **Details Screen:** large image (constrained by `AspectRatio`), description, and macros/ingredients widgets with scalable icon/text sizes.
- **LocalImage helper:** attempts to load remote image (`Image.network`) and falls back to an asset image (`Image.asset`) when the network resource fails or is unavailable (useful for web CORS or offline scenarios).
- **Responsive paddings & layout:** `SafeArea`, `ConstrainedBox`, and adaptive `EdgeInsets` ensure good spacing on phones, tablets and desktops. Texts are clamped with `maxLines` and `overflow` to prevent layout overflows.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Flutter (Dart)
- Firebase Auth
- Cloud Firestore
- flutter_bloc (BLoC pattern)
- VS Code (recommended) on Windows

## 🧭 Installation & Setup (Windows / Visual Studio Code)

1. Install Flutter SDK: follow the official guide for Windows: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows

2. Install Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/

3. Recommended VS Code extensions:
	 - `Dart` (Dart Code)
	 - `Flutter` (Dart Code)
	 - `Flutter Bloc` (optional)

4. Clone the repository and open in VS Code (PowerShell example):

```powershell
git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>
cd "C:\Users\<you>\Desktop\Aplicaciones Moviles\pizza_app_8sc_gmao"
code .
```

5. Install packages:

```powershell
flutter pub get
```

6. Firebase setup (Auth + Firestore):

	 - Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/
	 - Add Android and/or iOS/web apps to the Firebase project and follow instructions to register the app.
	 - For Android: download `google-services.json` and place it in `android/app/` (DO NOT commit this file).
	 - For iOS: download `GoogleService-Info.plist` and place it in `ios/Runner/` (DO NOT commit this file).
	 - For Flutter web: enable the web app in Firebase and copy the config into your local `lib/firebase_options.dart` generated by `flutterfire` CLI or created by following the official docs.

7. Generate `firebase_options.dart` (recommended):

```powershell
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
flutterfire configure --project "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
```

This will create `lib/firebase_options.dart` locally. IMPORTANT: keep this file out of source control (it's already added to `.gitignore` in this repo).

--

## 🔒 Secrets & Firebase Configuration (IMPORTANT)

- NEVER commit `google-services.json`, `GoogleService-Info.plist`, `lib/firebase_options.dart` or any service account files to the repo. They may contain API keys and identifiers.
- Use a secure mechanism to share runtime config with teammates (e.g., secure vault, private artifact, or an encrypted channel).
- If you accidentally pushed keys, rotate them immediately in the Firebase console and remove the files from the repository history (use `git filter-repo` or BFG) — contact your instructor if keys were shared.

## 📁 Project Structure (high level)

Top-level layout (selected folders):

- `lib/`
	- `main.dart` — app entry point
	- `app.dart` / `app_view.dart` — app routing and top-level Bloc providers
	- `firebase_options.dart` — local-only generated Firebase config (ignored)
	- `components/` — reusable widgets (e.g., `local_image.dart`, macros)
	- `screens/`
		- `home/` — `home_screen.dart`, `details_screen.dart`, views and widgets
		- `auth/` — sign-in / sign-up screens
	- `blocs/` — BLoC implementations and observers

- `packages/`
	- `pizza_repository/` — pizza data access (Cloud Firestore integration)
	- `user_repository/` — user data + Firestore user doc handling

--

## 🎯 How the App Works (demo)

- Launch the app, sign up or sign in with Firebase Auth.
- Home screen displays pizzas in a responsive grid.
- Tap a pizza tile to see details and macros.
- Images load from the network when available and fall back to local assets if they fail.

## ✅ Tips & Next Steps

- To test different device sizes use Flutter's device emulators or resize the web window.
- For production, enable Firestore rules and limit API keys usage.
- Consider moving secrets to environment variables or a secrets manager for CI/CD.
